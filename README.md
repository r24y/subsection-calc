# subsection-calc

Redux app.


## Start

```sh
npm start
```

## Code structure

You are encouraged to create a folder in `src` for each conceptual area your app has. For instance, a shopping app
might have `homepage`, `products`, and `cart` subfolders. This allows someone who's new to the project to glance at
the folder structure and not only know what the app does, but know where to go to make changes.

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```

note: jsdom >= v4.0 can not work on node 0.x
